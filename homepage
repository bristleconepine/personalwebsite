	Hey Everyone, thanks for checking out my website. I put it together partially because it's 2015 and job-seekers should have a website, but also because I think it's important to learn new things. I bought this domain and told myself I was going to brush up on my coding, and this is the result. It's not pretty, but I worked it all out myself from the ground up (with some help from bootstrap). <br>
		What am I going to use the website for? Mostly coding practice. I'm going to be slowly making improvements and teaching myself new things. I'll also be throwing little blog posts up here from time to time, linking to cool stuff that I find, things like that. <br>
			That's all for now, folks.
