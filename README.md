# personalwebsite

Just trying to build out a little personal website to host some of my video projects, maybe a little blog function, some links to stuff that I think is cool. 

I'm hoping to use this as an excuse to get better at coding, so I'm going to try and do most of it "from scratch" instead of just pulling code from other sites... but we'll see how that goes.
